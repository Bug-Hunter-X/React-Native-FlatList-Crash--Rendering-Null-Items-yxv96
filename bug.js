This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and you try to render an item that has a null or undefined value for a key prop.  This happens because the FlatList component relies on keys to efficiently track and update items in the list.  Without a unique key for each item, it can cause unexpected behavior, crashes, or incorrect rendering.

Example of buggy code:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{name: 'Item 1'}, {name: 'Item 2'}, null, {name: 'Item 4'}]}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index}
/>
```

In this example, the third element in the data array is `null`, which lacks the `name` property. Trying to access `item.name` will cause a runtime error.
